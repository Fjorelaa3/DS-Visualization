This project is a visualization tool for three fundamental data structures: stacks, queues, and binary search trees (BSTs). The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive and visual representation of these data structures, allowing users to understand their operations and behavior.

Features
Stack Visualization: Explore how items are added and removed from a stack using the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Visualize the push and pop operations and observe the current state of the stack.

Queue Visualization: Understand how elements are enqueued and dequeued in a queue using the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Visualize the enqueue and dequeue operations and observe the current state of the queue.

Binary Search Tree Visualization: Experience the insertion and deletion operations in a binary search tree. Visualize how elements are organized and understand the tree structure.

Interactive Interface: Interact with the visualizations using an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Perform operations, view the current state, and observe the changes in real-time.

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Used to build the user interface and handle the interactivity of the visualizations.
